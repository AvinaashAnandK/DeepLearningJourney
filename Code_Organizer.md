## Data Preprocessing 

Loading, cleaning, and transforming raw data into a format that's suitable for training models. 

### Computer Vision


## Model Architecture

(This section would contain code snippets and explanations for various model architectures used in CS231n, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNets, etc.)

## Training

(This section would contain code snippets and explanations for training loops, loss functions, and optimizers used in CS231n.)

## Evaluation

(This section would contain code snippets and explanations for model evaluation metrics and techniques used in CS231n.)

## Visualization

(This section would contain code snippets and explanations for visualizing data, model architectures, and results in CS231n.)

## Utilities

This section contains various utility functions that are useful across different stages of the machine learning pipeline.

### Loading Saved Models

```python
from six.moves import cPickle as pickle
import os
import platform

def load_pickle(f):
    version = platform.python_version_tuple()
    if version[0] == "2":
        return pickle.load(f)
    elif version[0] == "3":
        return pickle.load(f, encoding="latin1")
    raise ValueError("invalid python version: {}".format(version))

def load_models(models_dir):
    """
    Load saved models from disk. This will attempt to unpickle all files in a
    directory; any files that give errors on unpickling (such as README.txt)
    will be skipped.

    Inputs:
    - models_dir: String giving the path to a directory containing model files.
      Each model file is a pickled dictionary with a 'model' field.

    Returns:
    A dictionary mapping model file names to models.
    """
    models = {}
    for model_file in os.listdir(models_dir):
        with open(os.path.join(models_dir, model_file), "rb") as f:
            try:
                models[model_file] = load_pickle(f)["model"]
            except pickle.UnpicklingError:
                continue
    return models
```

This utility function loads saved models from disk. It's useful when you want to load pre-trained models for evaluation or further training.

**When to use**: Use this function when you have saved models that you want to load for inference, fine-tuning, or analysis.

**Important parameters**:
- `models_dir`: Path to the directory containing the saved model files

**Example usage**:

```python
saved_models = load_models('path/to/saved/models')
for model_name, model in saved_models.items():
    print(f"Loaded model: {model_name}")
```
